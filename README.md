# Insurance Application insight Project using powerBI
This Data file is from Enterprise DNA. After completting my bootcamp on Data Analysis, I decided to make more research by getting raw Data from Enterprise DNA and start my own journey.
# Problem Statement
This insurance application data from Australia generates vast amounts of data related to Customer Details, Insurance application, Collateral Type, Industry, Bank Details, Product types, customer demographics, and financial performance. With this dashboard i am trying to showcase the business insurance application in Australia to the sales manager and executives on how the application from clients is going. i have to analyse important Key metrics to filter that must be done in an insurance company at any giving time frame and date. However, extracting meaningful insights from this data remains a challenge due to fragmented reporting, inconsistent metrics, knowning the right key measures to use expecially if i want to showcase how many open applications have there been with time through out the years and difficulty in visualizing key trends. At first i was scared, because this visualization is going to require some Key Measures and i need to start making research on how to derive this calculation and form an UserRelationship between all this Data. Without a centralized and intuitive system, the struggle to identify risk patterns, assess profitability, optimize pricing strategies, and improve customer retention will be difficult.
# Solution
So creating a PowerBi Dashboard for This Insurance Application, aims to address these challenges by providing a dynamic, interactive visualization that consolidates critical insurance data into a single and clear view platform. By integrating real-time analytics, trend forecasting, and performance tracking of every single individual that applied to get insured. With this dashboard, it will empower more people to be applying for insurance and also allow stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, enhance operational efficiency, and improve financial outcomes. With a focus on clarity, accessibility, and actionable intelligence, this solution will transform raw data into strategic insight, helping insurers stay competitive in an evolving market and forsee the future benefits it will provide when they get insured.
# The Steps I Took In This Project
1. With my Liltle knowledge on AIMS grid for project planning,
2. I used Excel to retrieve the data into Power BI,
3. Then i did Data Cleaning in power query due to some errors and duplicates of data i found in the customers name,bank region and the date format,
4. I went ahead to Data Modelling and create some relationship both active and inactive,
5. Then i Performed ETL process (Extract Transform and Load),
6. The first thing i had to do was to create some Key Measures for needs and used them for creating visuals in PowerBi,
7. I had to make sure my internet connectivity was strong because i will be needing the map visuals to get the location and ariel view of the insured clients,
8. Then Data Validation was done, the final step was
9. Data Modelling and Visualization
# Major challenges and Customization made

**how many application have the clients been through at any time of the day**To get the right measure for this metrics of the dashboard was chanlleging. But after making some reasearch from Enterprose DNA i was able to get it right.

# Insights
1. In this dashboard, we can see total insured coverage for each customer and the total revenue of the insured coverage generated through-out the application process and year, 
2. Also in the dashboard, we can see the total annual premiums i.e the total annual income interest generated from each customers increased by 5% in total annual premium generated
3. In our top 5 customers, HIKMA groups is our biggest customer who has insured alot throughout the application process.
4. In our top 5 Industry,the INSURANCE industry remains the biggest and highest industry in the country and it has generated a lot of total revenue all through the years.
5. With all these evidence, there has been some shift in customers behaviour, in which most people are now  opting into our application process due to the availability and transparency the dashboard provides on the online platform.
# Future Consideration
I would like to create An insurance Application Insight APP. on Andriod version and IOS version so that it can made easy for applicants to fill our form from the comfort of their home or any where. It will provide more option and show the customer his or her on profile and anyways dont let me reveal too much. we can talk more about that when the need ariseðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰
# Key Learnings
1. Learned about what real business data sets look like.
2. Learned about how to write some major analysis queries in Excel.
3. how to connect the databaseâ€™s tables to Power Bi.
4. how to connect the excel files to Power Bi and how to clean & modify the unwanted data in Power Query.
5. Learned about some major practical DAX functions and measures.
6. Learned about how the map visuals work and how to locate an exact location to provide clear view of the location.
7. Learned about some major analytical visuals and reports.
8. I wrote all these by myself although it was daunting but i had to carry on. i think i deserve some AccoladeðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ‚..
