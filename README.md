# Insurance Application insight Project using powerBI
This Data file is from Enterprise DNA. After completting my bootcamp on Data Analysis by AlexTheAnalyst, I decided to make more research by getting raw Data from Enterprise DNA and start my own journey.
# Problem Statement
This insurance application data from Australia generates vast amounts of data related to Customer Details, Insurance application, Collateral Type, Industry, Bank Details, Products, customer demographics, and financial performance. However, extracting meaningful insights from this data remains a challenge due to fragmented reporting, inconsistent metrics, and difficulty in visualizing key trends. At first i was scared, because this visualization is going to require some Key Measures and i need to start making research on how to derive this calculation and form an UserRelationship between all this Data. Without a centralized, intuitive system, decision-makers struggle to identify risk patterns, assess profitability, optimize pricing strategies, and improve customer retention.
# Solution
So creating a PowerBi Dashboard for This Insurance Application, aims to address these challenges by providing a dynamic, interactive visualization that consolidates critical insurance data into a single and clear view platform. By integrating real-time analytics, trend forecasting, and performance tracking of every single individual that applied to get insured. With this dashboard, it will empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, enhance operational efficiency, and improve financial outcomes. With a focus on clarity, accessibility, and actionable intelligence, this solution will transform raw data into strategic insight, helping insurers stay competitive in an evolving market and forsee the future benefits it will provide.
# The Steps I Took In This Project
1.With my Liltle knowledge on AIMS grid for project planning,
2.I used Excel to retrieve the data into Power BI,
3.Then i did Data Cleaning in power query due to some errors and duplicates of data i found in the customers name,bank region and the date format,
4.Then i Performed ETL process (Extract Transform and Load),
5.The first thing i had to do was to create some Key Measures for needs and used them for creating visuals in PowerBi,
6.I had to make sure my internet connectivity was strong because i will be needing the map visuals to get the location and ariel view of the insured clients,
7.Then Data Validation was done, the final step was
8.Data Modelling and Visualization
